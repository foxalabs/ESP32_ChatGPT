# ESP32_ChatGPT

Library for the ESP32 and hopefully the new R4 Uno WiFi when it's out
(Note: json buffers set to 4096 bytes, so long replys may get truncated)

Please copy config_template.h to config.h and fill in your personal keys and certificates, this file in on the .gitignore list so it will be kept private from repo pushess.

You'll need a root cert from https://api.openai.com inserting into the config.h 
  To obtain the root CA certificate, you can follow these steps:

  1. Visit the OpenAI API using your browser: https://api.openai.com
  2. Click on the padlock icon in the address bar.

  3. Go to the "Details" tab.
  4. Click on the top certificate in the hierarchy (typically "Baltimore Root CA" or similar)
  5. Export or Save to File.

  Once you have the root CA certificate, open the exported file with a text editor and copy the content between -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END      CERTIFICATE-----.
  
  Please note that this simple example code uses SSL communication to ensure privacy, it does not perform any API_KEY obfuscation on the source code itself. While this may be acceptable for personal projects on your own hardware, more robust authentication methods should be employed for commercial ventures. 

This was built using PatformIO using ESP32 DEVKIT and only needs the ArduinoJson libary adding to build

There are two demos to chosoe from (use the enviroment selector in VSCode to choose)

Hi what's it like in there?
I'm an AI language model, so I don't have the ability to experience things like humans do. However, I am here to assist you in any way I can with tasks and answering questions. Is there anything specific that you need help with today?
what is an apple?
An apple is a round, edible fruit that comes in a variety of colors, such as green, red, and yellow. It is a good source of dietary fiber and vitamin C, and is often eaten raw as a healthy snack or used in various recipes, such as pies and sauces.

Thinking about adding Fucntion calling to the library, let me know if that is something users of the library would like.
